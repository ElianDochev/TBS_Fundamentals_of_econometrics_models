# TBS Data Analysis and Statistical Methods

This repository contains coursework for the Technical Business Statistics (TBS) module taught in the first semester of the fourth year. The course focuses on applying statistical methods and data analysis techniques to solve business problems.

## Course Overview

This module covers essential statistical methods for business analysis, with emphasis on:

- Linear regression modeling using OLS (Ordinary Least Squares)
- Data visualization and exploratory data analysis
- Statistical inference and hypothesis testing
- Multivariate analysis techniques
- Interpreting regression coefficients and statistical significance

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by lecture, with each folder containing Jupyter notebooks and associated datasets:

- **Lecture_2**: CEMEX dataset analysis (concrete composition modeling)
- **Lecture_3**: Orange market share analysis
- **Lecture_4**: Gender-based salary analysis (Norwegian data)
- **Lecture_5**: Student performance analysis
- **Lecture_6**: Tinder usage data and Spotify analysis
- **Lecture_7**: Group project work
- **Lecture_8**: CEO salary analysis

## Technical Environment

The notebooks use Python with common data science libraries:

- pandas for data manipulation
- numpy for numerical operations
- matplotlib and seaborn for visualization
- statsmodels for statistical modeling

## Getting Started

To work with these notebooks:

1. Ensure Python 3.10+ is installed
2. Create a conda environment: `conda create -n tbs python=3.10`
3. Activate the environment: `conda activate tbs`
4. Install required packages: `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels jupyter`
5. Launch Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`

## Note

This repository contains educational materials for academic purposes. All analyses and findings should be considered in the context of learning statistical methods and their application to business problems.
